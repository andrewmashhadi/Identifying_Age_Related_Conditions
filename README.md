# ICR - Identifying Age Related Conditions

Goal is to use modern machine learning methods to detect conditions with measurements of anonymous characteristics. This repository contains the code for my submission to the InVitro Cell Research's competition hosted on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icr-identify-age-related-conditions/overview.

Exploratory Data Analysis, XGBoost (with resampling), and PCA + XGBoost (with resampling) are performed / fit in the "baseline" script. Given the class imbalance, resampling techniques such as traditional oversampling and SMOTE are leveraged during training. The additional scripts consist of using the TabPFN from the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01848.pdf) and the TabTransfomer from Amazon. The TabPFN model was trained and tuned locally, while the TabTransformer was trained and tuned using SageMaker SDK (with EC2 GPU instances). All methods tried will ultimately save two files: (1) a CSV with probability estimates for an unseen validation set (2) a CSV with probability estimates for the test set. The probability estimates will be used for the competition submission.
