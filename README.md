# ICR - Identifying Age Related Conditions

Goal is to use modern machine learning methods to detect conditions with measurements of anonymous characteristics. This repository contains the code for my submission to the InVitro Cell Research's competition hosted on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icr-identify-age-related-conditions/overview.

Exploratory Data Analysis, XGBoost (with resampling), and PCA + XGBoost (with resampling) are performed / fit in the "baseline" script. Given the class imbalance, resampling techniques such as traditional oversampling and [SMOTE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.1813.pdf) are leveraged during training. The additional scripts consist of using the TabPFN from the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01848.pdf) and the [TabTransfomer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06678.pdf) from Amazon. The TabPFN model was trained and tuned locally, while the TabTransformer was trained and tuned using SageMaker SDK (with EC2 GPU instances in AWS). Additionally, an SVM model was also trained, tuned, and validated to be used within the ensemble. 

Two different approaches were used for ensemble learning. For the first approach, I tried directly averaging the probability results from the TabTransfomer, XGBoost, and SVM models. For the second approach, I fit a logistic regression model using the probability estimates from each independent model as the predictors. In a way, this second approach may be thought of as a final layer of a neural network, where the neurons are the probability estimates from each model.

All methods used ultimately saved two files: (1) a CSV with probability estimates for an unseen validation set (2) a CSV with probability estimates for the test set (which is to be submitted to the competition).
